# JavaScript

## Concepts Covered

Variables: Declaration and initialization of variables to store data such as mass, height, scores, and bill amounts.

Conditional Statements: Using if-else statements to compare BMI values and determine the winner in a competition based on scores.

Arithmetic Operations: Basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Logical Operators: Utilizing logical operators (`&&`) to conditionally calculate tips based on bill amounts.

String Literals: Incorporating string literals to format messages and output data with dynamic values.

Equality Operators: Using the `==` and `===` operators for comparison to check equality between values.

Arrow Functions: Definition and usage of arrow functions for concise function expressions.

Function Declarations: Using function declarations to define reusable blocks of code.

Anonymous Functions: Functions that are defined without a name and are often used as arguments to other functions or assigned to a variable.

Code Reusability: Creating reusable functions to avoid redundancy and improve code maintainability.

Arrays: Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

Arrays methods: Array methods are built-in JavaScript functions for manipulating arrays, including operations like adding or removing elements, iterating, filtering, mapping, and reducing.

Objects:

    Definition and Initialization: Creating objects to store related data and functions.

    Accessing Object Properties: Using dot notation and bracket notation to access and modify object properties.

    Adding Methods to Objects: Defining functions within objects to perform actions on the object's data.

    Using the this Keyword: Understanding and using this to refer to the object in which a method is defined.
